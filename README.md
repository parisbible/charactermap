# Character Map

These character maps are designed to show the way that letters are written in a variety of scripts in from Paris Bibles. The presentation of these characters lends itself to any kind of scriptural analysis (letter shapes) and comparisons. These character maps have been captured from screenshots from high quality manuscripts, and have been organized using the open source software for digital image management, (Tropy)[tropy.org].

At the moment, we divided our maps in lowercase, uppercase, and special characters. Other divisions may be available in the future.
The current maps come from three manuscripts:

Not all files may contain all the letters (work in progress!). The files are downloadable as JSON-LD files together with the images. The files are named according to manuscript_UNICODE_pagemanuscript
