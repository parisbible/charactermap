# Character Map

These carachter maps are designed to display a variety of scripts from Parisian Bibles. The presentation of these characters lends itself to any kind of scriptural analysis (letter shapes) and comparisons. These character maps have been obtained through the use of Tropy (tropy.org).

<br>

At the moment, we divided our maps in lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. Other divisions may be available in the future.
The current maps come from three manuscripts:
