# Character Map

These character maps are designed to show the way that letters are written in a variety of scripts in from Paris Bibles. The presentation of these characters lends itself to any kind of scriptural analysis (letter shapes) and comparisons. These character maps have been captured from screenshots from high quality manuscripts, and have been organized using the open source software for digital image management, [Tropy](tropy.org).

At present, we have divided our character maps into three categories: lowercase, uppercase, and special characters. Other divisions may be available in the future.
The maps in this version of the repository come from three manuscripts:
<br>

* MsWettF1, Aargauer Kantonsbibliothek, Switzerland: [facsimile](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/it/searchresult/list/one/kba/WettF0001)
<br>
* Lewis E M 063, Free Library of Philadelphia, United States: [facsimile](https://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0023/html/lewis_e_m_063_001-031.html)
<br>
* Corpus Christi College MS 485, Parker Library, Cambridge, United Kingdom: [facsimile](https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/xk876dn8316)

Not all folders contain all the letters of the alphabet (work in progress!). A JSON-LD file of the metadata accompanies the images (this file allows you to import the Paris Bible Project character maps into your own instance of Tropy.
